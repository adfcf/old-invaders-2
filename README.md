# old-invaders-2
## What is it?
It's a very simple Java game I made when I was younger. I've lost the source code, so I had the decompile the executable. It's a sequel of [old-invaders-1](https://github.com/adfcf/old-invaders-1). This time, there is textured sprites; a simple addition, but it makes the game much more fun to play.

## Important!
- This is a decompiled version which was uploaded here __almost (see below)__ exactly as it was produced. Thus, it contains strange formatting and unusual structures.
- The code itself also contains peculiar design decisions, but do remember this is very old and I was very young at the time.
- Unfortunately, I've had to replace the original sprites because I couldn't remember where I had got them (ownership issues). In addition to that, a little of the original code have had also to be updated for things to work correctly. 
- The original game used to have audio too, but, same problems; I haven't replaced the audio though, because I figured out the methods I had used long ago are deprecated, so I've just deleted all the code which deals with audio. It pains me to say this, but the game doesn't have any audio anymore.
